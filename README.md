## Sub-projects

The following folder hierarchy convention is to be used for subprojects within this repo:

```txt
+-- Assets
|   +-- Common
|   +-- [ProjectName]
```

where each sub-project is ideally a mostly-self-contained project that can make use of any Common or submodule assets.

### URP Template

The URP template was generated when creating this project. This has been included as an example of scene lighting, as well as reusable assets.
